I bought a new iPhone cell phone, less than a month it broke, the screen went out and it didn't work anymore, I took it to the store I was treated badly, nobody cared about my case, they sent it to assistance, I was supposed to have a new cell phone in my hands in two weeks, no one got back to me by email or message as promised, I had to go to the store again, I was poorly attended again, they promised me a new cell phone with a new contract, they asked for 5 documents, I provided them all, I went back to the store even so they said no the same thing that the store requested was enough, they asked for more documents, I provided it again, once again it was not enough, this happened three times, every day I went back to the store to be attended to, nobody knew what was going on when they were assisting me , I could clearly see that they were stalling and with no desire to resolve my case, I had already lost more than 5 days of work, no one from the company was going to pay for those days that I missed, and for a reason they requested from  documents to make a new contract and the same document they requested do not accept.  It's unbelievable what they're doing, for a company the size of TELSTRA, my biggest regret was leaving the operator VODAFONE, always very attentive.  Here's advice for anyone who is about to join and be a TELSTRA customer, stay away from this company and this store.  So far it's been over 1 month I still don't have my cell phone and they're dragging me down every day, they're not worried about my case, tomorrow I'm going to the store I only leave there with my cell phone or my contract cancelled.",2023-03-24,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqKH96wJZWX/"

"se.an2847","Telstra really need to give your retail stuff a good training on the customer care. My neighbour is a 86YO lady who lives along, her Telstra SIM card doesn't work in past few weeks, and no one can contact her, so I lent my spare SIM card to her for emergency use until her SIM card fixed. However, the 86YO went to the Telstra retail store earlier this week, the staff was really rushing and get her a new SIM card. Then she asked:â€ where's my neighbour's phone card?â€ The stuff said:â€ your SIM card has been fixed, you can use your phone now, I can't stay with you longer as other customers are waiting.â€ The next day I went to the same store with the senior lady and the staff said to us â€œI think the old SIM card is thrown away as we don't keep customers' stuff, and I can't remember what's happened yesterday because we are seeing over 200 customers a day, you can just simply call your mobile provider and ask for SIM card replacement, and it's for free.â€ I couldn't believe that's how the staff from the most reputable telco treat their customers. The good customer service is not about how many customers you are seeing daily, it's about how you solve the issues.

Coming into Christmas without a phone and feeling helpless. On a merry go round of customer care that won't escalate the problem and replace my phone. So upset. Feeling so powerless.

"salty_see","Hi @telstra ! My family was recently affected by the floods in northern NSW with our house going underwater. When my mum rang back to get her internet up and running again, you charged her $340 to reconnect her internet after her explaining to your customer service that she was a flood victim. She spent numerous hours on the phone to @telstra over several days trying to get her internet up and running and repetitively explaining that her house had been underwater and the modem no longer worked. You finally credited her but after 4 days of explaining the same situation over and over again. It wasn't until her breaking point that your customer service representatives finally did something. The treatment of my family over this situation is an absolute disgrace. The lack of empathy for your company is disgusting and makes me sad that you just don't care about your long standing customers especially in extreme situations.

"jshit","Read this before they erase it again. Last Telstra day we transferred 3 mobile phones from other carriers and 1 mobile broadband service to Telstra. We got a special rate for the 1st year or we wouldn't have agreed. Yet in the last day we've been informed that none of those rates will be honoured and instead we'll be charged more than what was full price as all prices went up on July 1. We were told we'd have 5G reception indoors by their coverage map. We have 1 bar of 3G outside if we're lucky. We were assured by the Eli who signed us up that my partner @lizhamdotcom could pay for her 2 services and I for my 2 yet we'd have a pool of data for all 4 to share as we'd have full authority on each other's accounts. What actually instead is that 500+ messages over 2 months to a revolving door of largely clueless support staff via your broken app has only today yielded a concession that we were promised something that could never be delivered. If we want to pool our data we have to fill out an 11 page change of ownership form and split all our bills off our own bat forever. When I finally reached an international complaints overseer a month ago she could not explain why the female half of our couple would only be granted limited authority for six months whilst I had full authority instantly. She said she would keep our case open yet closed it on the sly overnight. I now have to seek redress via the Ombudsman. Oh and we waited 4 hours for the follow-up appointment of a postponed-without-explanation visit by your techs to connect a landline (that was already a Telstra line under the last tenant and still had a dial tone, so why we have to be present for a physical visit Â god knows). Despite us honouring this set time for our second 'commencement day' by taking all of it off work to be here you neither turned up nor had the courtesy to call and say you wouldn't. We spent over an hour on hold to be told your own people have no idea why this visit never happened. They never do really. My case manager cannot even call or directly email me. A 'system limitation'. You are a telecommunications company that neither communicates nor provides the services you sell. Buyers beware!",2022-07-04,"1","https://www.instagram.com/p/CfVtPNipTdy/"

"imhereforsocialj","@telstra I don't need to you put out a fake and manipulative reply showing your phony care and interest towards customers on social media when your just money gauging all us customers and not delivering on promises. I prefer action and quality of service and putting those promises into action. On rainy wet weather days like today as always the internet is always not working and I have to use my mobile data and hotspot it for all my devices. Even with data there's glitches all the time and just get frustrating when needing to work and study. Using data that's unnecessary when Wi-Fi should be working. More resources should be allocated to better technology and infrastructure of internet or better education for the workers or find workers who are at top of their field from around the world to ensure the same issues get fixed. The NBN was a fail and a better solution is required.

"tailsclifford","Hi, my husband and I have been trying to return a watch to the telstra online store for over 6 weeks. I went in store and they sent me back to the website. No one will give us the return details we need. Short of going back in store and just throwing it at someoneâ€¦ what would you recommend??",2022-06-13,"1","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cec3hSnpct8/"
"tailsclifford","@tailsclifford @telstra the invoice number is ACC54091747 bought on 10.05.22 We tried to return 3 days later and we've been given the absolute run around ever since. Why does a simple return and refund required multiple escalations through live chat and the call centre? We just want to get this done and so far NO ONE can help!!!!! Please for the love of god use the invoice number to contact us so we can get this done.",2022-06-13,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cec3hSnpct8/"
"telstra","@tailsclifford Hi Taylor, thanks for reaching out here. If you purchased the watch outright it would be the store doing the refund or return. If it was put onto a payment plan on the account, it can be a little more challenging. Send me a DM when you get the chance, I'm happy to have a further chat about this there",2022-06-13,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cec3hSnpct8/"
"tailsclifford","@telstra it was purchased outright!! And we was categorically sent out of the Brisbane CBD telstra store and told telstra website purchases had to go back to the website. What do you know thoughâ€¦ after weeks of a diabolical customer experience, I post here and someone responds to sort it out. Although it will take 3 more days before we can return it!!! Utterly ridiculous and we won't be buying from Telstra again.",2022-06-13,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cec3hSnpct8/"

"amaysim","@npbevo Hey there. 5G doesn't inherently use more data than 4G. It's essentially a more advanced version of the current mobile networks we use with technology that allows for faster speeds, lower latency and greater capacity. With this said, it's generally assumed that as we start to use 5G, we will naturally start to consume more data thanks to the attributes of 5G and how seamless it makes downloading large files, streaming content in Ultra HD and connecting multiple devices at once. For this reason, if you do plan to use 5G, we recommend making sure you optimise your phone settings so you can make the most of the mobile data included in your plan. â€“Taylor",2023-08-03,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/CuRXR3brjWI/"

"chrisasilva","Bit late to the party but better late then never. I guess going off my comment from your previous postâ€¦ This is a war, on the scaled of which hasn't been seen in Europe for decades. Tens of millions of Ukrainians have spent over a week sheltering in make shift bomb shelters. Thousands are dead. Millions are and will be displaced. I see the offer to the flood affected regions and wonder why you say free talk and text for customers affected when this is what all amandine customers already receive. In the spirit of big love, can't you do better to connect people during this brutal war waged on a peaceful Ukraine than just the offer of credit from the month of March. Even if this war ended by the end of this month, the huge impact of this crisis wont subside that quickly and the need for communication will remain great.

"paul.t.ellis","You have a good point. And you have just highlighted the imbalance in domestic violence issues. Personally, 30 years ago I was married to an alcoholic wife, who would regularly inflict intoxicated psychological and physical violence. It was a traumatic experience. I moved on a very long time ago. But I always maintain that violence is far too often genderised and shouldn't be inflicted upon anyone, at all, regardless of gender. In this case, I focused on the humour of ""clicking"" rather than the violence. Yes, the characterisation is wrong, but it doesn't negate the humour of the annoyance of ""text clicking"". I do not condone violence in any way, at all. So, if my comment upset or disturbed you, or anybody else, I apologise honestly and sincerely. âœŒï¸ðŸ™",2022-03-02,"0","https://www.instagram.com/p/CagwdH4N-JE/"

"taco_t_dactyl","Haha, oh no. Charging at 75 percent. The batteries DO still have memory or at least cells, always best charged RIGHT UP when new before using leavimg for 1-5 hours on charge then start using... Short burst charges thru the day always make my phone run flat in just hours if done, even after my usual  night time full charge... I find it best to always let it rundown to 10-15 percent, then charge fully, for best battery life and battery longevity.  Overheating your phones def heaps bad, Samsung s4 under a year old lost all network data completely and needed wifi to get internet once.

This gives you 2GB of data to use over each renewal (so that's $10 every 28 days). We don't actually offer this plan anymore but we're happy to offer it to you as a special treat. Send us a DM with your account details and we can get the ball rolling on it for you. If you don't want to move to the $10 UNLIMITED 2GB plan that's ok, keep an eye out there might be something later on in the year that suits you better A_loveeyesƒ",2020-03-31,"1","https://www.instagram.com/p/B-L0Kx8HmMB/"
