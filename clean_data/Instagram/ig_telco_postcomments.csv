We are in WA. Been with Optus for over 13 years. Business mobile had an issue with the SIM card. Got a new sim but Optus has not activated it for almost 5 business days. So we are unable to reach our patients and confirm appointments. We had the same issue when we switched to NBN. Same issue with emails in the past that we had to dump Optus email and switch to google. Is this how you treat a loyal customer which is a small business. It's pathetic.

I bought a new iPhone cell phone, less than a month it broke, the screen went out and it didn't work anymore, I took it to the store I was treated badly, nobody cared about my case, they sent it to assistance, I was supposed to have a new cell phone in my hands in two weeks, no one got back to me by email or message as promised, I had to go to the store again, I was poorly attended again, they promised me a new cell phone with a new contract, they asked for 5 documents, I provided them all, I went back to the store even so they said no the same thing that the store requested was enough, they asked for more documents, I provided it again, once again it was not enough, this happened three times, every day I went back to the store to be attended to, nobody knew what was going on when they were assisting me , I could clearly see that they were stalling and with no desire to resolve my case, I had already lost more than 5 days of work, no one from the company was going to pay for those days that I missed, and for a reason they requested from  documents to make a new contract and the same document they requested do not accept.  It's unbelievable what they're doing, for a company the size of TELSTRA, my biggest regret was leaving the operator VODAFONE, always very attentive.  Here's advice for anyone who is about to join and be a TELSTRA customer, stay away from this company and this store.  So far it's been over 1 month I still don't have my cell phone and they're dragging me down every day, they're not worried about my case, tomorrow I'm going to the store I only leave there with my cell phone or my contract cancelled.",2023-03-24,"1"

My neighbour is a 86YO lady who lives along, her Telstra SIM card doesn't work in past few weeks, and no one can contact her, so I lent my spare SIM card to her for emergency use until her SIM card fixed. However, the 86YO went to the Telstra retail store earlier this week, the staff was really rushing and get her a new SIM card. Then she asked:â€ where's my neighbour's phone card?â€ The stuff said:â€ your SIM card has been fixed, you can use your phone now, I can't stay with you longer as other customers are waiting.â€ The next day I went to the same store with the senior lady and the staff said to us â€œI think the old SIM card is thrown away as we don't keep customers' stuff, and I can't remember what's happened yesterday because we are seeing over 200 customers a day, you can just simply call your mobile provider and ask for SIM card replacement, and it's for free.â€ I couldn't believe that's how the staff from the most reputable telco treat their customers. The good customer service is not about how many customers you are seeing daily, it's about how you solve the issues. It's really disappointed.",2023-02-03,"1"

Make $30 fixed price promises then sting small businesses $3000 phone bills. Only to then pretend they lost the recording of the Telstra employee advising the price. And lastly disconnect a businesses phone line - costing the small business thousands of dollars daily! Cutting the 20 staff members wages due to customers not being able to make contact.

My family was recently affected by the floods in northern NSW with our house going underwater. When my mum rang back to get her internet up and running again, you charged her $340 to reconnect her internet after her explaining to your customer service that she was a flood victim. She spent numerous hours on the phone to @telstra over several days trying to get her internet up and running and repetitively explaining that her house had been underwater and the modem no longer worked. You finally credited her but after 4 days of explaining the same situation over and over again. It wasn't until her breaking point that your customer service representatives finally did something. The treatment of my family over this situation is an absolute disgrace. The lack of empathy for your company is disgusting and makes me sad that you just don't care about your long standing customers especially in extreme situations. Do better.",2022-10-01,"0"

Last Telstra day we transferred 3 mobile phones from other carriers and 1 mobile broadband service to Telstra. We got a special rate for the 1st year or we wouldn't have agreed. Yet in the last day we've been informed that none of those rates will be honoured and instead we'll be charged more than what was full price as all prices went up on July 1. We were told we'd have 5G reception indoors by their coverage map. We have 1 bar of 3G outside if we're lucky. We were assured by the Eli who signed us up that my partner @lizhamdotcom could pay for her 2 services and I for my 2 yet we'd have a pool of data for all 4 to share as we'd have full authority on each other's accounts. What actually instead is that 500+ messages over 2 months to a revolving door of largely clueless support staff via your broken app has only today yielded a concession that we were promised something that could never be delivered. If we want to pool our data we have to fill out an 11 page change of ownership form and split all our bills off our own bat forever. When I finally reached an international complaints overseer a month ago she could not explain why the female half of our couple would only be granted limited authority for six months whilst I had full authority instantly. She said she would keep our case open yet closed it on the sly overnight. I now have to seek redress via the Ombudsman. Oh and we waited 4 hours for the follow-up appointment of a postponed-without-explanation visit by your techs to connect a landline (that was already a Telstra line under the last tenant and still had a dial tone, so why we have to be present for a physical visit Â god knows). Despite us honouring this set time for our second 'commencement day' by taking all of it off work to be here you neither turned up nor had the courtesy to call and say you wouldn't. We spent over an hour on hold to be told your own people have no idea why this visit never happened. They never do really. My case manager cannot even call or directly email me. A 'system limitation'. You are a telecommunications company that neither communicates nor provides the services you sell. Buyers beware!",2022-07-04,"1"

It's essentially a more advanced version of the current mobile networks we use with technology that allows for faster speeds, lower latency and greater capacity. With this said, it's generally assumed that as we start to use 5G, we will naturally start to consume more data thanks to the attributes of 5G and how seamless it makes downloading large files, streaming content in Ultra HD and connecting multiple devices at once. For this reason, if you do plan to use 5G, we recommend making sure you optimise your phone settings so you can make the most of the mobile data included in your plan. â€“Taylor",2023-08-03,"0"
